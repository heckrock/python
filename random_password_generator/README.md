# 🔐 Secure Password Generator

A simple Python-based command-line tool that generates a secure, randomized password based on user-specified criteria. You can choose how many **letters**, **special characters**, and **numbers** you'd like in your password.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Randomly generates uppercase and lowercase letters
- Includes a wide range of special characters (excluding problematic ones like quotes and backslashes)
- Adds numbers for stronger security
- Shuffles the password to prevent predictable patterns

---

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x (no external libraries needed)

---

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python password_generator.py


Answer the prompts:

How many letters are required? 6
How many special characters are required? 2
How many numbers are required? 3


The script will output a secure password like:
The Secure Password is: q@G5tA7#1xZ

🔒 Note
This is a simple educational project. For production-grade password generation, consider using libraries like secrets for cryptographically secure randomness.
